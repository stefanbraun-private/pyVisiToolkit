# =>indention is always done with two spaces, no tabs!
#
# =>about inheritation: referencing to an anchor means copying this node or attribut to the second position
#   behaviour of second position:
#     -adding new attributes does work
#     -when replacing an attribute then whole node tree gets replaced with this new data... no overwriting with some changed values possible... :-/
#
# USAGE:
#  name of function: any valid python identifier
#  vars: minimum one is required, name must be any valid python identifier, DMS-datapoint must exist
#  expr: any valid Python expression, but beware: it must evaluate to ONE value with datatype of "result"-datapoint, otherwise DMS doesn't accept value... ;-)
